            <p>
              We are a group of young adults who are passionate about the
              environment and the ocean. We believe that the ocean is a
              beautiful place that needs to be protected. We want to make a
              difference in the world by creating a sustainable water bottle
              that is good for the environment and good for you. Our mission is
              to create a product that is good for the planet and good for your
              health. We believe that by working together we can make a
              difference in the world and create a better future for everyone.
